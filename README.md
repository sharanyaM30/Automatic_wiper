# Automatic Windshield Wiper
Designed an auntomated rain detection and wiper control mechanism that activates wiper rotation (0 to 180 degrees) on detecting rain and displays 4 discrete controllable speed levels.
# Features
- Implemented a PWM generator that changes duty cycle and makes the mototor run at 4 different speeds of roatation according to amount of rain detected.
- Built a sophisticated dashboard that has 4 leds to detect speed of motor running along with a speedometer needle.
- Used Arduino UNO to program a servo motor to act as the needle of the speedometer.
